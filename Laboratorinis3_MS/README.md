The 3nd laboratory assignment required us to get accustomed to and create an interrupt system. An interrupt would be called whenever pushing a User Button, which would then change the frequency of a blue, built-in, diode. 
During this task, we also had to create and use custom Timers of different periods and to showcase that, blinking diodes were implemented, that toggled in different intervals.
