The 1st assignment - an introductory task, which required us to get accustomed to the IDE, it's innerworkings and had us create a simple LED output, based on either some variable logic or button presses:
  1) Using Orange and Red LEDs, periodically (in 1 second intervals) repeat binary value combinations of 0, 1, 2, 3.
  2) Make the Red LED blink every second, and the Orange LED - every two seconds.
  3) When the User Button is pressed, make the Green LED turn on, so that it would stay on even when the Button is released.
  4) Write a program, that would make the Orange LED blink every second, and when the User Button is pushed, that the interval would increase by 1 second.
