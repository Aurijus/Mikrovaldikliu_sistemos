The 4th laboratory work was about PWM programming, to gain more skills with it and be able to implement it to simple blinking diodes, that would toggle in irregular time frames.
In this task, we also got introducted and accustomed to „Input Capture Direct Mode“, which let us capture the time frames between two separate button presses and depending on the time, a sepcific diode would be toggled.
